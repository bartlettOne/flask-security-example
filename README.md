Took the basic flask-security example code from the documentation and modified it to work as a flask blueprint.

Also broke up the code into logical pieces with main/route.py and a templates folder, and a models.py all inside a app folder.


Updated this to flask-security-too because flask-security seems to be abandoned.


Updated this to have flask-admin


Got help from Miguel's work

Also used this to incorporate user authorization for the admin pages
